# LOG-BASED ANOMALY DETECTION USING PRE-TRAINED LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

Anomaly detection in log data refers to the process of identifying patterns or events in log data that deviate from the expected behavior or normal patterns. This is important for detecting po- tential issues in systems and ensuring that they are operating efficiently and securely. The evolution of techniques used for anomaly detection in log data has seen significant advancements over the years. Initially, rule-based systems were used to identify anomalies, but these systems were often limited by the specificity of the rules and were unable to adapt to changes in the data over a pe- riod of time. With the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence, new techniques were developed that leveraged these technologies to improve the accuracy and scalability of anomaly detection.

Machine learning techniques, such as clustering, decision trees, and neural networks, have been widely used for anomaly detection in log data. In recent years, the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) and transformers has become popular for this purpose. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network that are well-suited for handling time-series data and have shown great performance in detecting anomalies in log data. While the LSTM was a significant breakthrough in machine learning by enabling models to retain memory, the Transformer architecture goes further by introducing the self-attention mechanism and the ability to process entire sequences of input data in parallel. Transformers are a type of deep learning model that have been applied to a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks and are now being used in anomaly detection in log data to analyze and identify patterns in text data.

This research focuses on using pre-trained language models, such as BERT and GPT, for anomaly detection in server logs. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in detecting abnormal patterns and to identify suitable method for log parsing in this context. The research also aims to understand the explainability of the models and their limitations to identify areas for improvement and provide a comprehensive understanding of their performance.

The study will use log datasets from loghub, a publicly available platform, to ensure that the results are generalizable and aligned with industry standards. Overall, this research aims to contribute to developing more effective methods for log-based anomaly detection, which is crucial for identifying potential security breaches, system failures, or other events that may require attention.
